# AI Tool Usage Summary

## Overview
This project used AI assistance (ChatGPT/Cursor) for design and implementation guidance.

## AI-Assisted Development Areas

### 1. RTL Design
- **Initial Design**: AI helped structure the QNNA module hierarchy
- **Syntax Fixes**: AI-assisted in fixing Yosys compatibility issues (unpacked arrays, constant assignments)
- **Code Generation**: Initial RTL structure generated with AI assistance

### 2. OpenLane Configuration
- **Config Setup**: AI helped create OpenLane configuration files
- **Flow Scripts**: Interactive TCL script structure created with AI guidance
- **Troubleshooting**: AI-assisted in resolving OpenLane flow errors

### 3. Documentation
- **Documentation Structure**: AI helped create comprehensive documentation structure
- **Setup Guides**: Step-by-step guides created with AI assistance
- **Troubleshooting**: AI-assisted in creating troubleshooting documentation

### 4. Build System
- **Makefile**: Docker-based build system created with AI assistance
- **Error Handling**: AI helped implement proper error checking and validation

## Key AI Interactions

- Created project structure from scratch
- Set up OpenLane configuration
- Fixed initial syntax errors

### Session 2: RTL Fixes
- Fixed unpacked array syntax for Yosys compatibility
- Fixed constant assignment issues
- Simplified design for OpenLane compatibility

### Session 3: OpenLane Integration
- Configured OpenLane flow
- Fixed DIE_AREA and power pin issues
- Configured DRC handling

### Session 4: Documentation
- Created comprehensive documentation
- Added troubleshooting guides
- Created setup instructions

## Tools Used
- **Cursor AI** - Primary development assistant
- **ChatGPT** - Design guidance and troubleshooting

## Note
All code was reviewed and verified. The final implementation is fully functional and tested.
